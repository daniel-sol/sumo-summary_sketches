-- This workflow is intended to be ran as a HOOK workflow.
-- This workflow job is locally installed, from ert/bin/jobs.

-- Arguments:
-- ert_caseroot (Path): The absolute path to the root of the case on /scratch
-- vector_filter (str): filter for vectors to extract
-- global_variables_file (str): one global variables file

-- The workflow needs to be run post simulation, otherwise there is nothing to aggregate ;-)
